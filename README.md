# creative-password-generator
bootcamp random password generator project

## Description
The main goal of the week 3 homework was to demonstrate what has been learned during the previous week along with the javascript that we had just learned and demonstrate how to edit bare bones javascript code into a working random password generator.

Furthermore it shows our ability to learn and implement new coding languages with other languages and watch how the interaction between them gives us the final project.

## Purpose
The purpose is to use our knowledge gained from the prework exercises and apply them to a new project that involves using prewritten code to edit and save any changes into our own repository.
- The motivation for this project is to be able to display the ability to follow instructions, implement, and display a working end product.
- This project was created to simulate an on the job experience and deliver a working product for the share holder/employer.
- This project solve issues related to being able to take a starter code and edit into a working product that can be deployed to the customer.
- In this project I learned:
  - how to use bare bones javascript and editing to match the final product described.
  - understand the terminology and use it to create working end product.
